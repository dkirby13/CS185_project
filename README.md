SendBird Android Sample UI
===========

### Creating a SendBird Application

The first thing you need to do is to sign up in **[SendBird Dashboard](https://dashboard.sendbird.com)** and create a SendBird application.
You should use one application per one service across various platforms.
Users in different applications can't talk to each other.

### Open the project from Android Studio

You can open the sample project from Android Studio.

Build and run the Sample UI project to play with Open Chat or Group Chat.

- The sample project is shipped with **Testing App ID**.
- You must replace with your own **App ID** found in **SendBird Dashboard** for a production app.

**Note**
